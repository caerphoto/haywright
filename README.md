# Haywright

I random text generator based on the work of Brian Hayes.

TODO:

* Allow command-line params to specify length of output and size of comparison groups.

* Maybe unify the two methods a bit, since they more or less do the same thing.

* Move generator stuff into a module to minimise public API.
